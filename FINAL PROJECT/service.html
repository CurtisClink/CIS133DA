    <p class="service-section">Pet Adoption: Our primary service is pet adoption. We provide a loving and safe 
        environment for dogs and cats, offering them a second chance at a happy, forever home. 
        You can browse through our available pets and adopt the perfect companion for your family.
    </p>
<p class="service-section">Foster Program: In addition to adoption, we have a foster program where volunteers
    provide temporary homes for animals in need. This program helps us rescue and rehabilitate more pets, especially those with special needs or requiring extra care.
</p>
<p class="service-section">Spaying and Neutering: We prioritize the health and wellbeing of our animals. Before
    adoption, all pets are spayed or neutered to help control the pet population and ensure the 
    long-term health of your new family member.
</p>
<p class="service-section">Vaccinations and Medical Care: We provide essential medical care for our animals,
    including vaccinations, microchipping, and regular check-ups. Your adopted pet will be up-to-date on their shots and receive the best possible care during their stay with us.
