//three things that are implemented effectively
//consistent site header 
//informative page is included
//appealing to target audiebnce

//three things that could have been done better
//too much white space on a couple of the pages, could be modernized 
//no information regarding when the website was last updated
// no map included that shows where the business is loacated

// what I would do 
// I would ensure that most of the elements on the checklist were implemented to give my website a more professional feeling.
// I mainly would focus on making look more modern and less old feeling. The website example looks very dated and I would probably assume that the resort is no longer in business.
